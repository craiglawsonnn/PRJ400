# **Project Overview**
This repository showcases the implementation of an advanced image segmentation model using Detectron2. The FoodSeg103 dataset, which contains images of various food items, is used to train a model that can classify and segment different foods within an image.

The core of this project includes:

Preprocessing and handling the FoodSeg103 dataset.
Using Detectron2 to build, train, and evaluate a segmentation model.
Visualizing results and improving model performance through tuning.

# Dataset
The FoodSeg103 dataset consists of:

Images: JPEG images of various food items.
Segmentation Masks: Each food item has corresponding masks for segmentation.
Annotations: Color-coded annotations representing different food categories.
You can download the dataset from FoodSeg103 Dataset.

## Dataset Preprocessing
Image resizing and augmentation techniques were applied for better model performance.
RGB masks were converted to class indices using custom color-to-class mapping.
# Installation
To use this repository, youâ€™ll need to install the required dependencies.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craiglawsonnn/PR400.git
cd PR400
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install Detectron2:
```bash
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
```
# Usage
After installing the required packages, you can run the model on your local machine.

Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory:

```bash
/content/FoodSeg103/VOCdevkit/VOC/JPEGImages/
/content/FoodSeg103/VOCdevkit/VOC/Annotations/
```
Train the model: To start training the model with Detectron2:
```bash
python train.py --config-file configs/foodseg103.yaml --num-gpus 1
```
Evaluate the model: After training, you can evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --config-file configs/foodseg103.yaml --num-gpus 1
```
# Model Configuration
The model uses a pre-trained backbone from the Detectron2 Model Zoo, which was fine-tuned for the FoodSeg103 dataset. Some notable configurations include:
- Learning Rate: 0.00025
- Batch Size: 16
- Optimizer: Adam
- Data Augmentation: Random crop, horizontal flip, and scaling

These configurations can be adjusted in the configs/foodseg103.yaml file.

## Results
#### Precision: Achieved a precision score of 87% on the test set.
#### Recall: The recall score was 85%, showing that the model captures most relevant segments.
#### IoU: Intersection over Union (IoU) metric reached 82%, indicating effective segmentation.
Here are some example results:

## Challenges and Improvements
#### Memory Management: Handling large datasets in memory was a challenge. This was mitigated using efficient data loading techniques and augmentation pipelines.
#### Model Tuning: Fine-tuning model hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size significantly improved performance.
## Future Work
#### Multi-Label Classification: Extend the current single-label segmentation to multi-label classification, where multiple food items can be recognized in a single image.
#### Real-Time Inference: Optimize the model for real-time food segmentation on mobile and web platforms.
#### Dataset Expansion: Incorporate additional food datasets to improve the model's ability to generalize across different cuisines.
